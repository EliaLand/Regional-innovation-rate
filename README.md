# Exploring Factors Impacting Innovation Rates: an analysis on OECD Countries (2001-2015)

In this paper, we present a comprehensive panel regression analysis aimed at identifying the pivotal factors influencing a country's capability to attract innovation within the context of OECD countries. Our study covers a panel of 36 OECD countries spanning the period from 2001 to 2015. Through robust random effect panel regression models with robust standard errors, we delve into the intricate dynamics shaping innovation rates across nations.


## Data Analysis
In this study, we conducted a panel regression analysis to explore the factors influencing innovation attraction across 36 OECD countries from 2001 to 2015. Leveraging data from OECD.Stat and the World Bank Open Data, we constructed a panel dataset comprising key variables such as the Regional Innovation Rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP Growth Rate, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Trade Openness, Employment Rate, Gender Wage Gap Indicator, Fertility Rate, Public Spending on R&D, Public Spending on Education, and Public Spending on Healthcare. Our analysis involved rigorous data manipulation techniques, including handling missing values and ensuring stationarity of variables, to ensure the reliability of our findings regarding the complex relationship between economic variables, government policies, and innovation within OECD countries.


## Background and Methodology:
We initiated our analysis by considering factors directly influencing innovation rates, as suggested by existing literature and our domain knowledge. However, the measurement and observation of each variable and the external macro-dynamics affecting them (such as crises, trade sanctions, and war tensions) posed challenges. Consequently, we acknowledge the potential for bias in our estimation, despite rigorous robustness checks. Notably, bias could stem from individuals' likelihood to apply for patents during periods of solid economic growth, which may not necessarily reflect the conditions at the time of patent release.


## Model Specifications:
We explored three distinct model specifications: Macro-trends, Female Empowerment, and Government Expenditure Targets. Notably, the inclusion of social variables, particularly female empowerment, substantially improved model fitting. However, the primary contribution emerged from government expenditure targets.


## Key Findings:
- Surprisingly, we observed a negative association between higher GDP growth and innovation rates, highlighting the nuanced relationship between economic growth and innovation, potentially influenced by policy choices and resource allocation strategies driven by government expenditure targets.
- The unexpected negative correlation between public spending on education and innovation rates warrants further investigation, suggesting the presence of unobserved variables.
- Encouragingly, a robust positive relationship emerged between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and innovation, aligning with expectations. Similarly, government spending on research and development (R&D) and public spending on healthcare positively contributed to innovation rates.


## Implications and Conclusion:
Our findings underscore the complexity of the relationship between economic variables, government policies, and innovation within OECD countries. This complexity underscores the importance of considering gender-related factors and the need for further exploration of unexpected results, potential biases, and the intricate dynamics between different components of public expenditure and innovation. Our study sets the stage for future discussions, particularly focusing on variables that may shed light on endogeneity issues and deepen our understanding of the innovation landscape within OECD economies.
